# Test Defold Tutorial

This project tests that a Defold tutorial game can exist on a different server and build WebGL.

The game is from Defold's tutorial, and copyright by them or the author.

How to host project outside of King's servers:

I had some commits, so I also merged the histories:

    git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories

<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37937984/git-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories>

With Defold 1 editor it seems only one game is allowed per repo.
